## All roles

- Communicate with new hire before their start date
- Make their first day memorable
  - at Synthesio we usually have breakfast every morning but it's good to ensure we get one for this specific day. So at least this is the role of the manager of the new hire to bring it if needed
  - desk already set up and ready to welcome the new hire (ID badges, IDs and passwords for software...)
  - a welcome package with goodies and messages from office mates
  - a lunch scheduled with office mates
  - a company-wide email introducing the person with a quick introduction from the new hire (what bring us back to communication with the new hire before their start date ðŸ‘†)
  - ![My blablabla when I joined Synthesio](https://github.com/julplee/awesome-onboarding/blob/master/onboarding-company-wide-welcome-message.png "My blablabla when I joined Synthesio")
- Write a precise schedule for their first days (2 weeks schedule is a good period)
