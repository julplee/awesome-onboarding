## 📖 Communication

- Communicate with the new hire before their start date
- If possible, for both of you meet them
- make them meet the team and join teammates during informal events (e.g. after work)

## 👩‍🚀 Mentor

- Make sure they have a mentor that will bring them a lot of things
- The mentor is like your big brother in the company. He knows how to make you meet people, how to solve your new joiners’ problems, how to guide you in what is a new world for you.
- The mentor is also here to spend time with their mentee. We recommend having the mentor meet their mentee at least 30 minutes weekly to discuss different topics.
  - what did I learn this week?
  - what astonished me?
  - what will I do next week to continue my progress and so forth...

## 🌱 The first day

- Make their first day memorable
  - At Synthesio, we usually have breakfast every morning, but it's good to ensure we get one for this specific day. So, at least, this is the role of the manager of the new hire to bring it if needed.
  - The desk is already set up and ready to welcome the new hire (ID badges, IDs, and passwords for software...)
  - A welcome package with goodies and messages from office mates
  - A lunch scheduled with office mates from different specialties to get information from a lot of different views
  - a company-wide email introducing the person with a quick introduction from the new hire (which brings us back to communication with the new hire before their start date 👆). This often allows long-timers to get to know the new joiner rapidly and to strike up a conversation.
  - Below is an example of what I wrote when joining Synthesio:

## 🌅 The first 2 weeks

- Write a precise schedule for their first days: 2 weeks schedule is a reasonable period from our experience
  - Below is an example of an extract of what we prepare when someone joins Synthesio
  - ![Example of schedule raw file](https://github.com/julplee/awesome-onboarding/blob/master/onboarding-precise-schedule.png "Example of schedule raw file")
- Make them meet people from other departments and have these people give a presentation of their department and work
- Set expectations early and discuss them often: it's a good practice to set 1:1s from the beginning and define clear objectives so that you share expectations with the new hire
- Ensure the new hire meets often their mentor during the first two weeks especially if they don't work on the same projects
